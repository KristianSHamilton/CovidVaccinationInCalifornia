The null values got removed by groupby, so data for the tiny counties is not in here. I can't get the data county by county
from the CDC, but when I wake up tomorrow I will change the null values in my dfs then upload that the updated csvs. 
For now I need to get some sleep, it took me a long time to figure out how do convert the double groupby into a dataframe while getting the counts
since trying .sum() was freezing my computer.
